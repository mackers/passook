Passook is a perl script that automatically generates passwords. Passook is
customizable so that you can choose different levels between a very
pronounceable or a very secure password. Passook can be run in a unix shell or
as a cgi script.

First of all passook only works on a unix system, so /usr/dict/words
should be there. If it's in a different place you can find it with:
find / -name words -print
It also needs the egrep executable.

Usage:

passook [-n num] [-p plev] [-u usernames [-d delim]]

-n [num] where num is the number of passwords to generate
-p [plev] where pleve is the pronouncability level (1-5)
-u [usernames] where usernames is the file of users. passook will 
   prepend each password with each username in the file. It makes 
   sense to have [num] above as the number of usernames in the file.
   Use a unix (\n endings) file.
-d [delim] where delim is the deliminator between users/password
